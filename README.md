# Sentiment_Analysis
# Introduction  
I will do a sentiment analysis of the consumer complaint file to know which companies had the most sever complaints and which companies had good compliments

# Dictionary  
From the 18 columns present in the data, the ones we used for our sentiment analysis are the following:  

1. Company  
2. consumer response  
3. Issue  
# Cleaning the data  
1. Cleaning the data took most of the time during the analysis. The first thing that i did was renaming different columns into the names that we want so that it could be easier for us to read.  
```r
colnames(complaints_table)[1]<-"Date"
colnames(complaints_table)[6]<-"Consumer_response"
colnames(complaints_table)[15]<-"Company_response"
colnames(complaints_table)[18]<-"Complaint_ID"
```  
2. After that, i started breaking down the sentences under the consumer response column into individual words. this multiplied the dataset into millions which becomes hard to make a sentiment analysis. thus, we start using the stop_word function which cutts down unwanted words like "the", "is"..etc. then, we also cut of some words that are not important for our analysis.  
```r
Data_by_word <- selected%>%
  group_by(Company) %>%
  mutate(linenumber = row_number())%>%
  ungroup() %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, Consumer_response)

#removing unwanted words
Data_by_word <- Data_by_word %>%
  anti_join(stop_words)
Data_by_word<-filter(Data_by_word, word != "xxxx" )
Data_by_word<-filter(Data_by_word, word != "xx" )
```   
3. then i created sentiment values(positive and negative) for the companies to help us analyize the data even further and create pivot tables to analyze them. this also helps to rank the companies with the worst and best sentiments.
```r
Data_by_word %>%
  filter(Company == "Bank of America") %>%
  inner_join(nrc_joy) %>%
  count(word, sort = TRUE)
#Positive, negative and sentiment values for each companies
clean_Data <- Data_by_word %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(Company, index = linenumber %/% 80, sentiment) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = sentiment, values_from = n, values_fill = 0) %>% 
  mutate(sentiment = positive - negative)
#creating pivot tables to compare highest and lowest companies with sentiments
df <- clean_Data %>% group_by(Company) %>% 
  summarise(sum_sentiment=sum(sentiment),
            .groups = 'drop') %>%
  as.data.frame()
#put the data above in descending order
df2<-df[order(df$sum_sentiment, decreasing = TRUE),]
top_5<-df2[1:5,]
```

# Visualization of top 5 companies with positive sentiments  
the ggplot we used is:  
```r
ggplot(data=top_5,aes(Company,sum_sentiment))+
  geom_histogram(stat="identity",aes(color=Company))+
  labs( title = "Top 5 companies with good sentiments",x="Company", y="Sentiment value")+
  scale_color_manual(values=c('Red','Orange','Green','Yellow', 'Violet'))
  ```

as we can see above, customers(consumers) have responded positively to these companies. The Northern Trust company and Seure One Corporation have made a great job to have the highest positive sentiments according to the customres response.  
# Lowest 5 companies(highest negative values)  
```r
low_5<-df2[2679:2683,]
ggplot(data=low_5,aes(Company,sum_sentiment))+
  geom_histogram(stat="identity",aes(color=Company))+
  labs( title = "Top 5 companies with good sentiments",x="Company", y="Sentiment value")+
  scale_color_manual(values=c('Red','Orange','Green','Yellow', 'Violet'))
  ```

from the graph above, we can see that companies like Equifax, Bank of America, Experian, TransUnion Intermediate Holdings, Inc. and Wells Fargo had the most negative sentiments and responds from customers. Equifax should really improve becuase they have got the most negative sentimemnts from customers.  

# Words that had the most positive and negative sentiments  
some words had very large negative sentiment value and other words had positive sentiment value. to compare the word values, we initially separate the words into positive and negative, then we put their ranks aside to them.  
```r
#counting sentiments in the dataset above, nrc and bing 
get_sentiments("nrc") %>% 
  filter(sentiment %in% c("positive", "negative")) %>% 
  count(sentiment)

get_sentiments("bing") %>% 
  count(sentiment)
bing_word_counts <- Data_by_word %>%
  inner_join(get_sentiments("bing")) %>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup()
```  
after that, it was easy for me to plot the graph of the words comparison  
```r
bing_word_counts %>%
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  slice_max(n, n = 10) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(n, word, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(x = "Contribution to sentiment",
       y = NULL)
```

# Word Cloud  
last but not least, i created a word cloud from the dataset.
