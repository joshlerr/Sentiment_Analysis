# Sentiment_Analysis
# Introduction  
I will do a sentiment analysis of the consumer complaint file to know which companies had the most sever complaints and which companies had good compliments

# Dictionary  
From the 18 columns present in the data, the ones we used for our sentiment analysis are the following:  

1. Company  
2. consumer response  
3. Issue  
# Cleaning the data  
Cleaning the data took most of the time during the analysis. The first thing that i did was renaming different columns into the names that we want so that it could be easier for us to read.  
```r
colnames(complaints_table)[1]<-"Date"
colnames(complaints_table)[6]<-"Consumer_response"
colnames(complaints_table)[15]<-"Company_response"
colnames(complaints_table)[18]<-"Complaint_ID"
```
